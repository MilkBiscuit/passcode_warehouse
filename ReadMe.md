![Password Rules](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CMKb_QvUAAAZ2vH?format=png&name=small)

I'm pretty sure this is not new to anyone, you have to create different passwords for different websites, plus remembering them - if you ever forget, then you'll have to reset your password. Take me as an example, I once input incorrect password 3 times on a banking business account, then my account was deactivated, then I **have to** ask other administrators to help re-activate my account, next I **have to** phone the Business help desk to reset my password.

THIS IS SUCH A PAIN!

I am not a fan of LastPass, I'd rather save the password of some rarely-used accounts on the cloud note and then encrypt the note - I can't explain why, I just don't like it.

Just recently, I found it's extremely easy to make a desktop App via Python, so here it is, Passcode Warehouse, the local, offline version of LastPass.
